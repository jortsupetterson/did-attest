Retrieved: 2026-02-06
Status: Specification v1.0 (Identity Foundation)

Notes:
- Extends did:web to add verifiable history while keeping the same DID-to-HTTPS transformation.
- Introduces self-certifying identifiers (SCIDs), update keys, and a JSON Lines history file.
- Allows publish of both `did:web` and `did:webvh` for the same domain.
- Addresses did:web limitations such as lack of verifiable history and reliance on DNS without a history log.
